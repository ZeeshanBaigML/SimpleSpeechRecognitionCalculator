# SimpleSpeechRecognitionCalculator
This is a simple calculator program that uses speech recognition to perform basic arithmetic operations. It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input in the form of spoken commands.
# Features
Uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture and transcribe user speech input.

Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Provides a simple command-line interface for easy user interaction.

Uses the math library to perform mathematical operations.
# Requirements
Python 3.x

SpeechRecognition library (install with pip install SpeechRecognition)

pyaudio library (install with pip install pyaudio)

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries (see above).

Run the program using python calculator.py.

Speak your arithmetic command, e.g. "add 5 and 3".

The program will transcribe your speech and perform the requested operation, then display the result.

# Future Development
Improved error handling and input validation

Support for more advanced mathematical functions

Integration with other tools and APIs for added functionality
